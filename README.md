# 🎯 GuessTheFlag — SwiftUI Learning Project

This is my **second SwiftUI project**, built while learning more advanced SwiftUI features and concepts.  
I created this app to explore how to manage state, randomize data, and build interactive layouts in SwiftUI.

---

## 📱 About
**GuessTheFlag** is a simple quiz-style game that shows three random country flags and asks the user to guess the correct one.  
Each round updates automatically and keeps track of the player’s score.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
While building this app, I learned and practiced:
- Using **@State** to manage dynamic data  
- Creating **buttons with images** (`Button` + `Image`)  
- Displaying **alerts** with `alert()` modifier  
- Applying **randomization** with `shuffled()`  
- Styling UI with modifiers like `.clipShape()`, `.shadow()`, and `.tint()`  
- Structuring clean layouts using `VStack`, `Spacer`, and `ForEach`

---

## ⚙️ Built With
- **Swift**  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **Xcode**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add sound effects or animations when the player guesses correctly  
- Introduce multiple difficulty levels  
- Create a more polished results screen

⭐ *Still learning SwiftUI and improving with each project — this one helped me understand how data and views react together in real time!*
